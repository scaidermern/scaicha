# format:
#   left side: main tag followed by colon
#   right side: list of tags to substitute with main tag, separated by ','

# notes:
#   - leading and trailing whitespaces are automatically stripped
#   - usually we use the more common version as the main tag
#   - this list is mainly for correcting spelling errors, or different
#     notations (spaces, hypens), or tags with the _same_ meaning and
#     not for grouping similar tags together!
